1.open the file 20301031.cpp in c++ compiler
2.run the code and it asks for the use to enter the value of Nu
3.After entering the Nu value programme prompts to enter the number of time steps
4.After entering the timesteps the programme prompts to enter the type of initial solution and respective initial solution is represented 
  below
	1.Discontinuous initial solution
	2.Initial solution having two periods
	3.Initial solution having four periods
	4.Initial solution having six periods
	5.Initial solution having Gaussian curve
5.After that programme prompts to enter the finite different scchemes and the respective number is represented below.
	1.Forward Time Forward Space (FTFS) scheme
	2.Forward Time Central Space (FTCS) scheme
	3.Forward Time Backward Space (FTBS) scheme
	4.Lax-Wendro (LW) scheme
	5.Beam-Warming (BW) scheme
	6.Fromm (FR) scheme
6.one can enter any number of schemes one after the other and the programme execution ends if the number greater than above.if u want only
  one scheme enter the respective number and close the command window and one has to start from step 1 and follow them respecctively as per
  the requirement
7.The output file is written as 203010031.csv
8.The file is stored in respective folder where the source file is stores
